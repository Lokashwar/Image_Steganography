# Image-steganography

Image steganography is a technique where data is concealed within an image, encompassing both encoding (the process of hiding a message within an image) and decoding (the process of extracting the hidden message). This project can be realized using Python libraries such as PIL (Python Imaging Library) and Tkinter, enabling the seamless integration of image manipulation and graphical user interface development.
